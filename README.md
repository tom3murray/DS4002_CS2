File name | Description 
--- | --- 
train |original Train split of data as downloaded directly from Kaggle; contains ~160,000 images split between a Bald and NotBald folder; 2% bald / 98% not bald
test | original Test split of data as downloaded directly from Kaggle; contains ~20,000 images split between a Bald and NotBald folder; 2% bald / 98% not bald
validation | original Validation split of data as downloaded directly from Kaggle; contains ~25,000 images split between a Bald and NotBald folder; 2% bald / 98% not bald
ProjectData | dataset we fabricated for our project use which is significantly smaller to account for our limited processing power; contains 2,000 images split between a Bald and NotBald folder; 50% bald / 50% not bald
