### Installing/Building our code
Our code can be installed by anyone with access to this repo and run on their computer with a few unique adjustments. Users will need to edit the file path's for the "bald" and "notbald" datasets in each of the python scripts for the classification models. The path's should lead to the "Bald" and "NotBald" folders within the "ProjectData" folder within the general "Data" folder. 

### Usage of our code
As mentioned, our code is comptaible with use on any device containing a python environment. Just clone the repo, open up your environment, open our code, change the file paths, and hit "Run". We allow anyone and everyone to use and copy our code.

### src Folder Files
knn_model: runs our k-Nearest-Neighbor model on the ProjectData

decision_tree_model: runs our decision tree model on the ProjectData

deep_image_model: runs our CNN model on the ProjectData; also plots Accuracy and Loss of our model

## Data
File name | Description 
--- | --- 
train |original Train split of data as downloaded directly from Kaggle; contains ~160,000 images split between a Bald and NotBald folder; 2% bald / 98% not bald
test | original Test split of data as downloaded directly from Kaggle; contains ~20,000 images split between a Bald and NotBald folder; 2% bald / 98% not bald
validation | original Validation split of data as downloaded directly from Kaggle; contains ~25,000 images split between a Bald and NotBald folder; 2% bald / 98% not bald
ProjectData | dataset we fabricated for our project use which is significantly smaller to account for our limited processing power; contains 2,000 images split between a Bald and NotBald folder; 50% bald / 50% not bald
